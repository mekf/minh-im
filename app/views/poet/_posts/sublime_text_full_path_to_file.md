Sublime Text is my editor of choice due to its snappiness and versatility. The Linux edition shows full path to a certain file on its menu bar automatically however the OSX version only shows the name of the current file. It was alright at first until I started working on a huge app that have similar files in different namespaces (eg: app/controllers/ and app/controllers/admin/). It's actually pretty simple to enable this feature in Sublime.

Go to **Preferences – Settings – User** and then add this line:

`"show_full_path": true`

Restart and you are done. The title bar is now showing the full path to a certain file. This trick works in both Sublime Text 2 and 3.
